# whitakers-clj

`whitakers-clj` is a Clojure wrapper around Whitaker's Words.
Whitaker's Words can be found here: https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words

This project is still under active development and is fairly incomplete.

Whitaker's Words produces output like:
```
$ ./bin/words agricolarum
agricol.arum         N      1 1 GEN P M                 
agricola, agricolae  N (1st) M   [XAXBO]  
farmer, cultivator, gardener, agriculturist; plowman, countryman, peasant;
agricolar.um         ADJ    3 2 GEN P X POS             
agricolaris, agricolaris, agricolare  ADJ   [XAXES]    uncommon
farmer-; relating to farmers;
```

`whitakers-clj` parses that into a Clojure object:
```
[{:options
  [{:sectioned-word "agricol.arum",
    :stem "agricol",
    :ending "arum",
    :part-of-speech :noun,

    :number :plural,
    :gender :masculine}],

  :dictionary-entry "agricola, agricolae",
  :definition
  "farmer, cultivator, gardener, agriculturist; plowman, countryman, peasant;",

```
